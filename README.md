# VS Code Development Diagnostic Tools

This extension helps testing and developing various features (such as the merge and diff editor) in VS Code by providing some diagnostic/development features.

The target audience of this extension are developers working on VS Code itself or users that file bugs for VS Code.

## Commands

### Diagnose Diff Editor: Report Bug

Use this command to quickly report a bug for the diff editor.
It will pre-fill the GitHub form to create an issue in the vscode repository.
The pre-filled form includes a link to the monaco editor playground.
If you only want to share a fragment of the diff, select text on either side before invoking this command.

### Diagnose Diff Editor: Open In Monaco Editor Playground

Use this command to open the current diff in the monaco editor playground.
Used for the report bug functionality.

## Context Menus

### In `merge-conflict` folders: Reproduce Conflict In Playground

This commands expects the folder to contain the files `base.ext`, `input1.ext`, and `input2.ext` (`ext` being some file extension, e.g. `ts`).
Invoking the command creates a git conflict in a given folder, where input2 is merged into input1 and base being the common base.

### In `merge-conflict` folders: Open Folder In Merge Editor

This command expects the folder to contain the files `base.ext`, `input1.ext`, and `input2.ext` (`ext` being some file extension, e.g. `ts`).
Invoking the command opens the merge editor for the given files.

## Custom Editors

### Diff JSON Viewer

This viewer is used to display the diffs produced by the [VS Code diff snapshot tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/2af3045474f52bad8f14f01b09acfd5912e7fb5a/src/vs/editor/test/node/diffing/fixtures/random-match-2/advanced.expected.diff.json).

## Debugger Scripts

This extension allows to run custom scripts when debugging in VS Code.
The VS Code repository makes use of this to enable hot reloading.

### Configuration

Custom scripts can be specified with the `vscode-diagnostic-tools.debuggerScripts` property in the corresponding launch config of the debug session.
The debugger scripts property is expected to be an array of absolute file paths. Use `${workspaceFolder}` to refer to the workspace folder of the launch config.

For example:
```json
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Run Extension",
			"type": "extensionHost",
			"request": "launch",
			"args": ["--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}",],
			"outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"],

			"debuggerScripts": [
				"${workspaceFolder}/scripts/my-debugger-script.js"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

### Scripts

A debugger script is a NodeJS module which is expected to export a function called `run` of type [`RunFunction`](./src/debugger-scripts-api.d.ts).
This function is called for every new debug session. The returned dispose function is called when the debug session ends (or when the debugger script is reloaded).

Such a script could look like this:
```js
// @ts-check
/// <reference path='debugger-scripts-api.d.ts' />

console.log('script loaded');

/** @type {RunFunction} */
module.exports.run = async function (debugSession) {
	console.log('script started');

    // This code runs in the debugger
    debugSession.evalJs(function (data) {
        // This code runs in the debuggee (assuming it can evaluate JS expressions)
        console.log(data);
    }, 'some JSON serializable data');

	return {
		dispose() {
			console.log('script stopped');
		}
	};
};
```

Debugger scripts are automatically reloaded when changed.
Before the new script is loaded and executed, the `dispose` function of the previous script is called.
The `dispose` function is also called when the debug session stops.

When multiple debug sessions load the same script, the script is only loaded once, however, the `run` function is called for every debug session.
